        <h2 id="desi"><u>ChangHoon Hahn's Research Proposal</u></h2></br> 
        Spectroscopic galaxy surveys produce detailed 3D distributions of galaxies 
        that serve as one of the most effective probes of the growth and expansion 
        histories of the Universe. 
        They also provide statistically powerful datasets to investigate the evolution 
        of galaxies across cosmic history. 
        With these surveys, we can explore fundamental questions about our Universe: 
        What is the nature of dark energy that drives the accelerated expansion of the Universe? 
        What is the sum of neutrino masses, Mnu?
        What are the physical processes that drive galaxy evolution?

        My research thus far has focused on leading the next-generation spectroscopic 
        galaxy surveys, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Prime 
        Focus Spectrograph (PFS), that will observe 50 million galaxies across 10 billion 
        years of cosmic history. 
        In addition, I have pioneered cutting-edge machine learning (ML) tools that I 
        demonstrated can maximally extract cosmological information from these surveys. 

        My research program will focus on applying the ML tools that I have
        developed to the most powerful galaxy datasets from DESI and PFS. 
        This research program will address fundamental questions in cosmology. 
        In particular, I will: 
        (1) settle cosmic tensions between early and late-time measurements of the growth 
        and expansion histories, 
        (2) make a 6sigma detection of Mnu, and 
        (3) constrain key physical processes that drive galaxy evolution. 
        </br>


        <h2 id="desi"><u> Leading the Next-Generation Galaxy Surveys</u></h2></br>
        The standard LCDM cosmological model, despite its remarkable success,
        has recently come under scrutiny from cosmic  tensions, whose
        statistical significance has continued to increase with the latest
        observations. 
        The strongest of the tensions is the Hubble tension, which refers to
        the 5sigma disagreement between the late-time and early-time
        measurements of the expansion history of the Universe (H0). 
        There is also a 2sigma tension among measurements of the growth of
        structure (S8). 
        Insight into the cosmic tensions has the potential to reveal new physics beyond 
        LCDM and shed light on the nature of dark energy.

        Over the next five years, DESI and PFS will produce the leading galaxy samples for 
        addressing both cosmic tensions. 
        In its first year, DESI already observed more galaxies than all
        previous spectroscopic surveys combined.
        PFS will begin observing next year. 
        From the 3D distribution of the millions of DESI and PFS galaxies, we
        can use Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) as a standard ruler to
        measure the expansion history. 
        We can also use redshift-space distortions to measure the growth history.
        My leadership and expertise in DESI and PFS will uniquely position my
        group to lead galaxy clustering analyses that address both cosmic
        tensions.

        In DESI, I served as co-chair of the Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS), one of the main
        DESI surveys.
        I led the development of its target selection, survey design, observing strategy, 
        and science verification. 
        I am currently leading the construction of the BGS galaxy catalogs and 
        the spectrophotometric analysis efforts.
        In PFS, I am a co-leader of the Cosmology Survey, where I am leading the target 
        selection and developing the main cosmological analyses.  
        For my substantial contributions, I was awarded Builder in DESI and
        Continuing Participant in PFS, which will grant my group full access to their data.
        </br>

        <h2 id="desi"><u>2. Settling Cosmic Tensions with SimBIG</u></h2> </br>
        In addition to leading DESI and PFS, I have developed new methods that use ML techniques
        to maximally exploit their cosmological information. 
        Current analyses focus on extracting Gaussian information in the galaxy distribution 
        on large scales. 
        Yet, my work has demonstrated that there is substantial non-Gaussian
        information in galaxy clustering and on small scales.

        To extract this additional information, inaccessible to current analyses based on 
        perturbation theory, I developed SimBIG. 
        SimBIG uses simulation-based inference (SBI) with deep generative
        models (e.g. ChatGPT) to perform highly efficient cosmological
        inference using simulations.
        By using high-fidelity simulations, we can accurately model galaxy clustering down to 
        small scales and account for detailed observational effects. 
        Applied to the SDSS-III BOSS observations, SimBIG increases the
        precision of H0 and S8 by 1.5 and 2x over standard analyses.
        With this increased precision, my work has already produced S8 and H0 constraints 
        that are competitive with other cosmological probes. 

        My group will apply SimBIG to DESI and PFS.  
        Students will lead the development of state-of-the-art galaxy simulations, building 
        on my past work.
        They will also pioneer new SBI techniques.
        Our  SimBIG analyses will produce leading constraints on both S8 and H0.
        Furthermore, our S8 and H0 measurements will span redshift 0 to 2.4 and
        bridge the gap between early- and late-time measurements from weak
        lensing, supernovae, cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments.
        This research has the potential to either settle current S8 and H0 tensions or 
        to uncover deviations in the cosmic growth and expansion histories from 
        LCDM and reveal new physics.

        <h2 id="desi"><u>3. A 6sigma Detection of the Sum of Neutrino Masses</u></h2> </br>
        With galaxy clustering, we can also precisely measure Mnu. 
        Neutrino oscillation experiments placed a lower bound of 0.06 eV and provided 
        conclusive evidence of particle physics beyond the Standard Model. 
        A precise Mnu measurement can distinguish between the normal and
        inverted mass hierarchies to provide further insight into particle
        physics.
        However, upcoming laboratory experiments will not have the  sensitivity
        to precisely distinguish between the hierarchies. 

        On large scales, neutrinos behave like cold dark matter and contribute to 
        the clustering of matter. 
        However, on small scales neutrinos free-stream and do not contribute 
        to the clustering.
        This scale-dependent imprint can be measured from galaxy clustering 
        to constrain Mnu. 
        In fact, the tightest Mnu bounds currently come from combining
        constraints from CMB and galaxy clustering.

        The standard galaxy clustering analyses that I will lead in DESI and PFS will measure 
        Mnu with 0.030eV precision. 
        This more than doubles the precision of existing constraints.
        It would exclude the inverted hierarchy at 1.5sigma if the neutrino masses 
        are minimal and the hierarchy is normal (blue; Fig. 2).
        I will improve the DESI and PFS Mnu constraints even further with SimBIG.
        I demonstrated that non-Gaussian galaxy clustering is especially important for
        Mnu because it breaks key parameter degeneracies. 
        Furthermore, the imprint of Mnu is strongest on small scales. 
        SimBIG can exploit both regimes. 

        My group will extend SimBIG to include Mnu and apply it to DESI and PFS.
        We will build on my work with both conventional and ML-based simulations. 
        Our SimBIG analysis will improve the precision of DESI and PFS constraints by 
        3x and place the tightest constraint on Mnu to date, sigma Mnu = 0.010 eV.
        Our Mnu measurement would correspond to a 6sigma detection of Mnu and, 
        if the neutrino masses are minimal, a 4sigma distinction between the neutrino 
        mass hierarchies.
        Furthermore, it will shed light on neutrino physics and provide key input for 
        physics beyond the Standard Model.

        <h2 id="desi"><u>4. Beyond Scaling Relations of Galaxies</u></h2> </br>

        Current galaxy formation models reproduce the global scaling relations of
        galaxy properties from observations. 
        Yet, disentangling the physical processes driving galaxy evolution 
        requires going beyond scaling relations and characterizing the 
        high-dimensional space of galaxy properties and connecting it across 
        cosmic history. 
        DESI and PFS will provide spectrophotometry of tens of millions of 
        galaxies across z=0-5 and produce ideal galaxy samples.
        Combined with probabilistic ML, they present a key opportunity to
        precisely trace galaxy populations across 12 billion years.

        With Bayesian spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling, we can infer
        properties of a galaxy such as its stellar mass and star formation history. 
        However, this SED modeling requires sampling a high-dimensional posterior 
        and takes many CPU hours per galaxy.
        This makes analyzing even a million galaxies computationally infeasible. 
        Neural inference can amortize the computational cost of such analyses
        and make them scalable to tens of millions of galaxies.
        I used neural emulators and generative models to  accelerate SED
        modeling by 10^2 - 10^5x.
        Using these methods, my group will infer the properties of all 50 million 
        DESI and PFS galaxies.

        This work will produce the largest catalog of galaxies properties 
        to enable precise population inference of galaxies over z=0 - 5. 
        My group will use this catalog to build on my population inference and 
        apply hierarchical Bayesian modeling to address open questions in
        galaxy formation: e.g., initial mass function variations. 
        We will also extend my work in testing galaxy formation models to 
        disentangle the physics processes of galaxy evolution. 
        My group will also explore using galaxy properties as cosmological
        probes.
        With both leading methodology and data, this program will establish the 
        rigorous statistical foundations necessary to usher in an era of precision
        galaxy studies. 
        </br>

        <h2 id="desi"><u>5. ML-Driven Discoveries in Galaxy Evolution</u></h2> </br>
        DESI and PFS will probe an unprecedented diversity of galaxies.
        In the nearby universe, DESI will observe dwarf galaxies that can be used
        to test models of dark matter. 
        Meanwhile, PFS will probe galaxies in the early universe. 
        Combined with new ML techniques, this data presents a key opportunity to  
        address fundamental questions in galaxy evolution. 

        I demonstrated that ML models with physics-informed neural networks can 
        capture more information in observations while  providing interpretability. 
        They can also be used for neural inference, classification, and anomaly 
        detection.
        My group will use these ML tools to explore the new discovery space 
        unlocked by the 50 million DESI and PFS galaxies. 
        This work has the potential to discover new galaxy populations and 
        astronomical phenomena. 

        My ML tools will also enable studies of galaxy populations with newfound 
        statistical rigor and precision.
        I developed ML tools that accelerate modeling of galaxy observations by
        10^5x and enable the inference of millions of galaxy properties. 
        By leveraging these tools, my recent work showed that we can better
        characterize galaxy populations and even use them as competitive
        independent cosmological probes.

        My group will extend this ML-driven approach and my work in galaxy
        evolution to the DESI and PFS samples. 
        Students and postdocs in my group will lead projects that investigate
        the connection between galaxies and their dark matter environments.
        With the advantage of both leading methodology and data, this work will shed new 
        light on the physical processes that drive galaxy evolution and establish a 
        statistical foundation for studying galaxy populations.

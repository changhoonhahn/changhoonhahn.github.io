        <a href="https://www.desi.lbl.gov">DESI</a> is an upcoming spectroscopic 
        survey that will map the spatial distribution of galaxies over an unprecedented 
        cosmic volume in order to probe fundamental physics. By measuring the clustering
        of galaxies, DESI aims to precisely measure the growth of structure and constrain 
        dark energy through redshift-space distortions (RSD) and the Baryon Acoustic 
        Oscillations (BAO). 
        <u><a href="https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2019/10/28/desi-opens-its-5000-eyes-to-capture-the-colors-of-the-cosmos/">DESI recently achieved first light</a></u>!
        </p>
        <p>
        I'm a <u>co-chair of the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey</u> (BGS), which will observe 
        a magnitude-limited sample of ~10 million galaxies over a third of the sky out 
        to z~0.4. In addition to enabling the most precise measurements of low redshift 
        BAO and RSD, BGS will also provide exciting opportunities for new multi-tracer 
        methods and small-scale clustering analyses. 
        </p>
        <p>
        As part of the Galaxy Quasar Physics working group, I'm currently leading the 
        construction of a <u>fully probabilistic value-added catalog of BGS galaxies (PROVA-BGS)</u> 
        with posteriors of galaxy properties inferred from jointly fitting photometry and 
        spectra. This catalog will allow us to apply hierarchical probabilistic 
        methods and make robust population inference of galaxies. Also, with its statistical 
        power, BGS will produce the largest low redshift galaxy sample and serve as an 
        anchor for upcoming high redshift surveys (e.g. JWST and WFIRST).

        <h2 id="neutrinos"><u>Neutrinos</u></h2></br>
        Galaxy clustering provides a unique opportunity to probe fundamental particle physics. 
        <u>Neutrinos suppress the growth of structure below their free-streaming scale
            and leave imprints on the galaxy distribution that can be measured to constrain
            the total mass of neutrinos, M&nu;</u>. Constraints from cosmology 
        already place significantly tighter constraints than particle physics laboratory
        experiments. More precise M&nu; constraint can potentially distinguish between the 
        neutrino mass hierarchies and probe particle physics beyond the Standard Model.
        </p>

        <p>
        The best cosmological constraints currently come from combining CMB and BAO. M&nu;
        constraints from CMB rely heavily on precisely constraining the optical depth of
        reionization, which upcoming CMB experiments will not significantly improve.
        The next LSS experiments, meanwhile, will expand the cosmic volumes probed with galaxies 
        and have the potential to significantly improve M&nu; constraints. Standard two-point 
        galaxy clustering analyses, however, are severely limited by degeneracies between M&nu; 
        and other cosmological parameters. Higher order statistics, such as the bispectrum, 
        help break these degeneracies and tightly constrain M&nu;.
        In fact, I demonstrated using the Quijote simulation suite 
        [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05273">1909.05273</a>]
        that <u>the bispectrum alone can constrain M&nu; >5x tighter than the power spectrum</u>
        [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11107">1909.11107</a>].

                halo bispectrum (orange) compared to the power spectrum (blue). The bispectrum improves constraints
                on &Omega;m, &Omega;b, h, ns, and &sigma;8 by factors of 1.9, 2.6, 3.1, 3.6, and 2.6 over 
                the power spectrum. For M&nu;, the bispectrum improves constraints by a factor of >5.

        </figure>
        <p>
        Now that I've demonstrated the potential of the bispectrum, I am currently working 
        on a number of projects that are laying down the framework for a full bispectrum 
        analysis of DESI to constrain M&nu;: including a comprehensive bias model, data compression for the 
        bispectrum, testing paired-fixed simulations, and developing more efficient simulation
        based inference methods.

        <h2 id="lss"><u>Large-Scale Structure</u></h2></br>
        Before DESI, I was a part of SDSS-III <a href="http://www.sdss3.org/surveys/boss.php">BOSS</a> 
        and SDSS-IV <a href="https://www.sdss.org/surveys/eboss/">eBOSS</a>, 
        where I worked on a wide variety of problems in large-scale structure analyses.

        Fiber-fed spectrographs of these surveys are essential for collecting millions 
        of redshifts. Fibers, however, can't be placed close to each other on the focal 
        plane, which biases galaxy clustering and prevents accurate constraints on 
        cosmological parameters. I developed methods that successfully account for this 
        "fiber collision" down to smaller scales than ever before
        [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01714"><font color="DarkBlue">1609.01714</font></a>].

        <h2 id="galaxy"><u>Galaxy Formation / Evolution</u></h2><br/>
        Galaxies broadly fall into two categories: star-forming and quiescent.
        Over cosmic time significant fractions of star-forming galaxies rapidly 
        "quench" their star formation and become quiescent 
        [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7162"><font color='DarkBlue'>1412.7162</font></a>]. 
        State-of-the-art galaxy formation models (hydro sims, semi-analytic models, and 
        empirical models) qualitatively reproduce global distributions and scaling relations 
        of galaxies in observations.
        However, <em>qualitative</em> comparisons to a mixed bag of observations are 
        <em>insufficient</em> for answering key questions in galaxy formation.
        </p>
        <p> 
        As part of the <a href="https://iqcollaboratory.github.io/"><font color='DarkBlue'>IQ collaboratory</font></a>, I am leading an effort to forward model
        observables (photometry and spectra) of simulated galaxies and compare them
        observation in a data-driven and quantitative approach. As the first step, 
        I compared the relation between star formation rate and stellar mass of 
        star forming galaxies in multiple galaxy formation models in a consistent
        data-driven fashion to reveal nearly an order of magnitude differences  
        among them
        [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01665"><font color='DarkBlue'>1809.01665</font></a>]. 
        Next, we will present comparisons of forward model observables for these 
        simulations and galaxies in SDSS at low redshift and CANDELS at high 
        redshift.

                large discrepancies.

        Hierarchical structure formation predicted by &Lambda;CDM provides a 
        concrete framework for galaxy formation and evolution: central galaxies 
        reside at the core of dark matter halos while satellite galaxies orbit 
        around them. Empirical models can be constructed in this framework by
        combining cosmological N-body simulations with observed trends in the 
        galaxy population (<i>e.g.</i> stellar mass function) and used to 
        constrain specific well-posed questions in galaxy formation. 
        Using this approach, I've constrain the timescale of star formation quenching 
        in central galaxies
        [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04398"><font color='DarkBlue'>1609.04398</font></a>], 
        demonstrate that large-scale "galactic conformity" is driven by contamination 
        [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01121"><font color='DarkBlue'>1702.01121</font></a>], 
        and measure the strength of assembly bias
        [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08458"><font color='DarkBlue'>1705.08458</font></a>,  
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01991"><font color='DarkBlue'>1610.01991</font></a>]. 
        Most recently, I used empirical models to demonstrate that the stellar-to-halo 
        mass relation can be used to constrain the timescale of star formation variability
        [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01644"><font color='DarkBlue'>1910.01644</font></a>].

        <h2 id="stats"><u>Statistical Methods</u></h2></br>
        The standard statistical analysis typically make a major assumption in their 
        parameter inference that the likelihood function is Gaussian. This assumption,
        which ultimately relies on Central Limit Theorem, breaks down in the low S/N 
        regime. For LSS, I demonstrated that <u>assuming a Gaussian likelihood can 
            significantly bias cosmological parameter constraints</u> and that methods
        using independent component analysis and Gaussian mixture models 
        can more accurately estimate the likelihood.
        [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06348"><font color='DarkBlue'>1803.06348</font></a>].
        </p>
        <p>
        Assuming a Gaussian likelihood, or any functional likelihood, is not necessary for
        probabilistic inference. <u>Simulation-Based inference (SBI) methods enable accurate 
            parameter inference without making assumptions about the likelihood</u> (also 
        known as "liklelihood-free inference"; LFI). One of the most popular LFI methods 
        today is Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). I was the 
        first to implement ABC in LSS analyses and demonstrate its feasibility 
        [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01782"><font color='DarkBlue'>1607.01782</font></a>].
        I recently organized a <a href="https://lfitaskforce.github.io/FlatironMeeting/">LFI workshop</a> 
        that brought together experts from across disciplines to share the latest LFI 
        techniques, use cases and applications, and to discuss open challenges. Continuing from
        the workshop, I am part of a <a href="https://github.com/LFITaskForce">LFI taskforce</a> 
        whose aim is to develop a general LFI framework and a LFI handbook for cosmology.
